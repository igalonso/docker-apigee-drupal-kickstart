Apigee Dev Portal Kickstart Drupal + Docker
---

Using the `quick-start` command is great on your local machine, but doesn't play nice a Docker container.

Here is simple setup that lets you run the Apigee Drupal Kickstarter and use Nginx to access the local development server. This is not for production.

See [here](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-devportal-kickstart-drupal)


To Use:
``` bash
# prerequisite: set APIGEE_XXX variables

# build and run the container
./start.sh
```
